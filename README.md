# ML_project_UCS611

This is the source files for the UCS611 project based on SARS-COVID-19 epidemic modelling.

The model has been developed by 

Name: Puneet Mishra
Roll Number: 101715121
Batch: ENC 6

The model has the aim of implementing the following,

1. Build an ML model for predicting the number of total infections in India till 31st of July 2020.

2. Build an ML model for predicting the number of deaths in India till 31st of July 2020.

3. Build an ML model and predict recovery rate and death rate in India for the period 15th June to 31st of July.

4.  Build an ML model and predict recovery rate and infection rate in India for the period 15th June to 31st of July.

5. Build an ML model and predict death rate for the countries for which data are available  in the age group 35-50 till 31st July of 2020.

6. Build an ML model and predict infection rate for which data are available in the age group 35-50 till 31st of July 2020.

7. Using information obtained from the above models and other data available on the link predict the tentative date (or interval spanning a week) after which the infection spread is 25% of its peak value in the world and in India.
